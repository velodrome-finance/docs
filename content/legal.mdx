The terms of use of the Website contained herein (the "Terms of Use") are entered into by and between the Website user ("You") and Velodrome Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the "Foundation" or "We/Our/Us"). These Terms of Use explain the terms and conditions by which you may access and use Our Services.

NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved, and the applicability and legality of which will be determined by an arbiter in the first instance. Our Services and Our Website are only available to You — and You should only access any of Our Services or Our Website — if You agree completely with these terms.

## Our Services

Our Website (and Our Services) provides a web or mobile-based means of access to a decentralized protocol on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum and Layer 2s built on top of Ethereum, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets (the "Protocol").

Our Website and Our Services are distinct from the Protocol and are one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself comprises self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains, such as Ethereum and Layer 2s built on top of Ethereum. We do not control or operate the Protocol. It is impossible for anyone to control or operate the immutable smart contracts that make up core aspects of the Protocol. By using the Website or Our Services, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from Us and that We do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to voters and/or liquidity providers. In addition, We are not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties.

To access Our Services, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service . We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to Our Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.
