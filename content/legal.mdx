NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved, and the applicability and legality of which will be determined by an arbiter in the first instance. Our Services and Our Website are only available to You — and You should only access any of Our Services or Our Website — if You agree completely with these terms.

## Our Services

Our Website (and Our Services) provides a web or mobile-based means of access to a decentralized protocol on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum and Layer 2s built on top of Ethereum, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets (the "Protocol").

Our Website and Our Services are distinct from the Protocol and are one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself comprises self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains, such as Ethereum and Layer 2s built on top of Ethereum. We do not control or operate the Protocol. It is impossible for anyone to control or operate the immutable smart contracts that make up core aspects of the Protocol. By using the Website or Our Services, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from Us and that We do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to voters and/or liquidity providers. In addition, We are not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties.

To access Our Services, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service . We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to Our Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.

Further, nothing on this Website should be construed as a recommendation, by Us, Our affiliates, or any third party, to acquire or dispose of any investment, or to engage in any investment strategy or transaction. You should consult your own investment, legal, tax and/or similar professionals regarding your specific situation and any specific decisions.

Our team provides the Website as a service to the public, and is not responsible for, and expressly disclaims all liability for, damages of any kind arising out of use, reference to, or reliance on any information contained within the Website.

You are responsible for understanding all risks, doing your own due diligence, and making your own decision on how to interface with the Website and Our Services.  If you interface with the Website and Our Services, you do so understanding that the Protocol is made up of immutable smart contracts that We do not control, that liquidity pools are permissionless to create, that We do not supply liquidity or operate liquidity pools, and that, as a result, when you interact with tokens on the Protocol you are interacting with and relying on third parties who do supply liquidity and operate liquidity pools.

## Compliance with tax obligations

## Security

Security audits don't eliminate risks completely. The Website and Our Services are not guaranteed to be secure or free from bugs or viruses.

It further means You are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets You hold and You should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to You, in connection with Your use of a wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding how any of Our Products will operate with any specific wallet.
