# Security Overview

As a commitment towards the safety of our users and partners, we want to
be transparent about the changes and the status of the security audits of our
smart contracts.

<div>
  Before moving forward, we'd like to remind our users that
  security audits do not eliminate risks completely and that
  every user should read and agree to our legal disclaimer before they continue
  using this website.

The Velodrome team's $100,000 bounty was matched by the Optimism Foundation. The program is offering up to **$200,000** in bounty for smart contract reports.

<br />
## Emergency Council

To support the health of the protocol and ecosystem, there is a Council
consisting of members from the Velodrome team and prominent figures from within
the Optimism.

The Council can be spawned in case of emergency situations or by passing
a governance proposal that requires the council's help to be executed.

The Council address is at **`0x838352F4E3992187a33a04826273dB3992Ee2b3f`** and it:

- can set a new `emergencyCouncil`
- can kill a gauge
- can revive a gauge
- can set a custom name or symbol for a pool
- can activate or deactivate (m)veNFTs (superseded by the governance once enabled)
