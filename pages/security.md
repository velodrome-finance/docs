# Security

As a commitment towards the safety of our users and partners, we want to
be transparent about the changes and the status of the security audits of our
smart contracts.

Velodrome Finance was adapted from Solidly, which [codebase was open
sourced in full](https://github.com/solidlyexchange/) by Andre Cronje and his team in
March 2022. Since its release in February on Fantom network, no security
incidents related to Solidly smart contracts were reported.

Velodrome Finance open-source repositories can be found at:
https://github.com/velodrome-finance

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Before moving forward, we'd like to remind to our users that
  security audits do not eliminate risks completely and that
  every user should read and agree to our
  [legal disclaimer](/legal) before using Velodrome Finance!

  For security reports, please reach out to us on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/bqzYruhX), or to the contacts provided on our Github page.

## Changelog

As of May 2022, we've compiled a changelog of the Velodrome smart contracts.

### Gauges/Bribes/Voting

 *  Staggered epoch for _Gauges_ / _Bribes_ to ensure rewards go to the right users
 *  Added a Compound-style weighted NFT governance for killing _bad_ gauges. This
    governance uses block.timestamp instead of block.number because it's on an
    L2.
 *  Removed `veNFT` _boost_ for liquidity pool staking
 *  Gauges can be added for any address for _Commissaire_
 *  Removed negative voting

### Emissions

 * Updated emissions schedule (see the formula in [Emissions in the
   Tokenomics](/tokenomics#emissions))
 * Added core team emissions

### Pairs

 * Added variable fees for stable/volatile pairs

### Distribution

 * Added two _redemption_ contracts for `$WEVE` (veDAO token) to `$VELO` +
 * `$USDC` which uses LayerZero

### Areas of Concern

As we're not changing any of the core swap logic, the bulk of our security
concerns relate to the native token emissions, governance, and distribution:

 * `Gauge.sol` and `Bribe.sol`, which introduce new logic related to how
   external bribes and voting work
 * `VotingEscrow.sol`, which adds compatibility with _OZ_ / _Compound_-style
   governance tools like Tally
 * `RedemptionSender.sol` and `RedemptionReceiver.sol` both use LayerZero for
   cross-chain messaging

## Audits

Solidly went through a partial (only the AMM part was sent for audit) security
audit in January 30, 2022. The audit was done by PeckShield and did reveal 5
low-severity and 1 informal findings.

The full audit is available for [download from Solidly git
repository](https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly/blob/master/audits/e456a816-3802-4384-894c-825a4177245a.pdf).

We also ran a full MythX deep scan on Velodrome contracts and found just a
handful of false-positive, low-severity issues reported.

## Bug Bounty Programs

Velodrome Finance run a [bug bounty contest on 23rd to 30th of May 2022 with
awards up to $75,000 on Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-05-velodrome-finance-contest).
The main scope of the contest was to cover all the new changes to the new and
the original contracts.

This way Velodrome Finance is happy to join efforts with the Solidly bug bounty
program, which was launched in February 2022 (first on Immunefi.com) and already
offers rewards up to $200,000 ([on their
Github](https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly/blob/master/SECURITY.md)).
