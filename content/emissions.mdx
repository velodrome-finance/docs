# Emissions

The initial supply of `$VELO` is 400M.

Weekly emissions started at 15M `$VELO` (3.75% of the initial supply)
on June 4th 2022 and decay at 1% per week (epoch).

With the release of v2 on 22nd of June 2023, the emissions were reset back to
15M.

`$veVELO` holders receive a rebase proportional to epoch LP emissions
and the ratio of `$veVELO` to `$VELO` supply, thus reducing vote power
dilution for `$veVELO`!

<br />

The weekly rebase amount is calculated with the following formula:

> (veVELO.totalSupply ÷ VELO.totalsupply)³ × 0.5 × Emissions

`$veVELO` supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity
providers.

## Emission Rewards

Liquidity providers (LPs) receive `$VELO` emissions as rewards for staking their liquidity positions.

Emissions are distributed to liquidity pools proportionally to the `$veVELO` voting power they receive each epoch. LPs receive a share of the `$VELO` distributed per pool proportionally to the size of their positions and time staked.

These rewards are streamed and available for claiming as they accrue.
