# SDK

This guide applies to both, Aerodrome and Velodrome (Superchain).

This document covers mainly the write functions, for accessing the data, please
check Sugar:

* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/sugar
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/sugar-sdk

For the contract addresses, please check:
* https://aerodrome.finance/security#contracts (for Aerodrome)
* https://velodrome.finance/security#contracts (for Velodrome/Superchain)

## Basic Pools

Please refer to the [Liquidity Pools](liquidity) for general information.

The volatile and stable pools are mostly compatible with the Uniswap V2
interface.

### Deposits

To deposit into a pool, the allowance for the ERC20 tokens should be granted
to the Router:
* https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IRouter.sol (for Aerodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IRouter.sol (for Velodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-contracts/blob/main/src/interfaces/IRouter.sol (for Superchain)

If the pool does not exist, the amounts should follow the ratios of
* 1:1 for stable pools
* arbitrary for volatile pools

For existing pools, a call to the `quoteAddLiquidity()` will return the
estimated amounts for a deposit.

The `amountBDesired` value should be set to a large value, consider something
like:
```
parseUnits(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.toString(), tokenB.decimals)
```
Using the
* quoted amounts,
* minimum amounts (where a slippage is applied),
* and unix timestamp in the future for the deadline

To deposit, call `addLiquidity()` or `addLiquidityETH()` if depositing native
tokens.

The call will return ERC20 tokens representing the LP tokens.

### Fees Claiming

To claim the fees, call the Pool contract function `claimFees()`:

* https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IPool.sol (for Aerodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IPool.sol (for Velodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-contracts/blob/main/src/interfaces/pools/IPool.sol (for Superchain)

### Staking / Unstaking

LP tokens from depositing into basic pool can be staked if the pool has a
gauge.

Note: staking LP tokens will reward the depositors with emissions instead of
fees!

To stake LP tokens, the allowance for these tokens should be granted to the
pool Gauge contract:
* https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/gauges/interfaces/IGauge.sol (for Aerodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/gauges/interfaces/IGauge.sol (for Velodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-contracts/blob/main/src/interfaces/gauges/ILeafGauge.sol (for Superchain)

Calling
* `deposit()` with the LP tokens amount will stake the liquidity
* `withdraw()` with the LP tokens amount will unstake the liquidity

### Emissions Claiming

To claim emissions for a staked deposit, call the Gauge contract function
`getReward()` passing the LP depositor address.

## Concentrated Pools

Please refer to the [Liquidity Pools](liquidity) for general information.

The concentrated pools are mostly compatible with the Uniswap V3 interface.

### Deposits

To deposit into a pool, the allowance for the ERC20 tokens should be granted
to the NonfungiblePositionManager contract:
* https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/periphery/interfaces/INonfungiblePositionManager.sol
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/periphery/interfaces/INonfungiblePositionManager.sol
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-slipstream/blob/main/contracts/periphery/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol

If the pool does not exist, an initial `sqrtPriceX96` (pool price) will have to
be provided.

To get a quote, call the SugarHelper contract functions `estimateAmount0()` or
`estimateAmount1()` with the token amount and the initial pool price. If the
pool exists, the pool current price will be used instead:
* https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/periphery/SugarHelper.sol#L49-L109 (for Aerodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/periphery/SugarHelper.sol#L49-L109 (for Velodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-slipstream/blob/main/contracts/sugar/SlipstreamSugar.sol#L49-L109 (for Superchain)


To deposit, using the
* quoted amounts,
* minimum amounts (where a slippage is applied),
* pool tick spacing,
* low/high tick values,
* and unix timestamp in the future for the deadline

Call the `mint()` function on the NonfungiblePositionManager contract (pass
`sqrtPriceX96 = 0` if the pool exists, non-zero value will try to create the
pool).

The NonfungiblePositionManager contract will mint an ERC721 token (NFT) for
every deposit.

### Fees Claiming

To claim the fees, call the CLPool contract function `collect()`:
* https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/core/interfaces/pool/ICLPoolActions.sol#L67-L87 (for Aerodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/core/interfaces/pool/ICLPoolActions.sol#L67-L87 (for Velodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-slipstream/blob/main/contracts/core/interfaces/pool/ICLPoolActions.sol#L43-L61 (for Superchain)

### Staking / Unstaking

To stake a concentrated liquidity deposit, the allowance for the ERC721 token
should be granted to the pool CLGauge contract (if available):
* https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/gauge/interfaces/ICLGauge.sol (for Aerodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/gauge/interfaces/ICLGauge.sol (for Velodrome)
* https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-slipstream/blob/main/contracts/gauge/interfaces/ILeafCLGauge.sol (for Superchain)

To stake the ERC721, call the CLGauge `deposit()` function with the NFT id.
Call the `withdrawn()` function to unstake.

### Emissions Claiming

To claim emissions for a staked deposit, call the Gauge contract function
`getReward()` passing the deposit NFT id.

### Burning

The concentrated pool deposit NFT can be burned if:
* all the liquidity has been withdrawn
* all the fees were claimed
* all the emissions (if any were claimed)

To burn the ERC721 token, call the NonfungiblePositionManager `burn()`
function. This call can also be bundled into a native `multicall()` function
call along with a `collect()` call.

## Pricing tokens

To get token prices in ETH, call [getManyRatesToEthWithCustomConnectors](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/spot-price-aggregator/blob/ed3321144324da0b07ddf1fe9b2effcb56c54663/contracts/OffchainOracle.sol#L359). Rates are returned multiplied by ETH decimals + the difference in decimals to ETH. You will need to normalize these using something along these lines (example code in python): 

```python
# where r is the rate you get back from getManyRatesToEthWithCustomConnectors
# and nr is normalized rate
if t.decimals == eth_decimals: nr = rate
elif t.decimals < eth_decimals: nr = rate // (10 ** (eth_decimals - t.decimals))
else: nr = rate * (10 ** (t.decimals - eth_decimals))
```
