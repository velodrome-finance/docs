# Superswaps

> Onchain swaps infrastructure as a public good, built on Superchain.

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

To understand the need for something like Superswaps, let's take a look at the
core dependencies and the constraints that allow exchanging tokens across
multiple blockchain networks.

### Native Liquidity

Projects create tokens and need to pair these with some other tokens in order
to price them. The liquidity pools are launched to provide the price for a
token in real-time based on the exchange rate.

Every blockchain has their own tokens and pools. And while the tokens can have
a representation on other chains, creating pools on the native chain is the
most common, easiest and cheapest way for projects to launch.

Expanding the token beyond the native chain requires significant operational
effort and costs:

- Setting up the interoperability between the native and the bridged tokens
  requires working with bridge providers and takes significant effort and
  operations. Failure to do this properly leads to high security risks.
- Bridged token pricing needs onchain oracle data or a new chain's liquidity
  pool. These pools require a large amount of native tokens to be bridged and
  paired with the new chain liquidity. This gets expensive as the paired
  liquidity and incentives for these have high costs.

### Decentralization

Native tokens and liquidity pools are common to be both permissionless and
decentralized. With the bridged liquidity, the infrastructure necessary to make
the communication with the native chain requires centralization, e.g., bridge
APIs and computing nodes.

The permissioned nature of the bridges and the risk of vendor lock-in, along
with the differences in the token format and the interoperability specs,
increase the risk of liquidity fragmentation and make cross-chain liquidity
operations difficult and risky.

### Interoperability

Projects that want a representation of their token on other chains have to

- deploy a new token on the new network
- connect the new token with the old token via a "bridge" and
- find a way to provide the token price.

The canonical blockchain "bridges" are considered the safest, but are also the
slowest. As an alternative, independent bridge providers are used to provide
the interoperability between the native and non-native tokens.

Every bridge provider operates independently and has their own security
requirements, supported networks and fees. Most of the bridge operators also
require specific token formats that are not compatible with canonical bridges,
also raising concerns around the risk of vendor lock-in.

## Architecture <a id="architecture"></a>

<SVG src="/svg/docs/superswaps.svg" className="w-full max-w-full h-auto mt-4" />

With all the components and the constraints of building cross-chain liquidity,
it's easier to explain the core architectural decisions behind Superswaps.

- Native liquidity focused: Superswaps are designed to support native chain and
  project needs. Token creators need native exposure to their chain and
  liquidity. Projects should be spending time building instead of maintaining
  bridges and liquidity pools or adding security concerns.
- Full permissionless decentralization: Superswaps should operate exclusively
  onchain. There should be no need for tokenlists, APIs, order books or other
  off chain services that can go down. Real-time permissionless execution is
  the only way to scale along with faster block times and market movements.
- Futureproof, fast and cheap interoperability: Superswaps should not require
  vendor lock-in, allow native and non-native bridges and be compatible with
  upcoming interoperability that's cheaper, faster and trust-minimized.

The first two requirements are embedded in the Velodrome core philosophy by
building on top of the decentralized and immutable infrastructure of the
protocol. Every new chain on Velodrome gets native immutable pools and the
necessary onchain APIs for offchain needs.

### Dual Interoperability

The interoperability layer was the missing part that has been designed to
implement the upcoming native Superchain interoperability specs along with the
fully functional open source interoperability from Hyperlane.

The message sending and receiving components both allow for swappable modules.
The modularity of the message transportation allows for virtually any bridge
provider to be supported. The preference for Hyperlane is thanks to no
requirements for a specific token format and their chain-agnostic open source
implementation.

The Superchain module implements support for the upcoming native
interoperability along with the Superchain ERC20 token format. These modules
will be replacing the "classic" interoperability layer the moment native
Superchain messaging goes live.

The full specs on interoperability are available
[on Github](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/superchain-contracts/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md#features).

### Interoperable Routers

Routers are the entry point for token swaps. Routers communicate with the pools
directly and provide an interface for developers to operate the tokens
exchange.

Superswaps extend the general functionality of the Universal Router released by
Uniswap with additional commands that allow for cross-chain execution of router
commands.

The newly introduced commands that enable communication via messaging between
the routers are

- `BRIDGE_TOKEN`
- `EXECUTE_CROSS_CHAIN`
- `TRANSFER_FROM`

The full router specs are available
[on Github](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/universal-router/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md#technical-architecture).

### MEV Protection

Routers operating on pure onchain messaging suggest there's no built-in
privacy. Since anybody can see swaps arriving from other routers / chains,
these can be timed by other onchain players to their benefit (MEV).

Developed together with Optimism and Hyperlane, Superswaps implement the
support for privately relaying the swap commitments. The functionality is also
known as [Submarine Sends](https://libsubmarine.org) and allows separating the
information about what's being swapped from the rest of the transaction.

### Intermediary Stablecoin

<SVG src="/svg/docs/superpools.svg" className="w-full max-w-full h-auto mt-4" />

Routers require an intermediary token to transfer the value from one chain to
another. Superswaps are operating on the Open USDT stablecoin for the
cross-chain value transfer.

Open USDT operates on the same dual interoperability layer as the Superswaps.
It implements the XERC20 + SuperchainERC20 token formats allowing the swaps to
be initiated outside the Superchain from EVM and non-EVM users.

### Real-time onchain API

Three years ago, Velodrome introduced an onchain API. The concept replaced
completely the need of running databases, indexers and generally offchain
infrastructure. Superswaps leverage to the full extent the ability to fetch the
data for quoting a swap in real-time.

Sugar, the name of the onchain API, is the thin data layer that's between the
deployed smart contracts that encapsulate the complexity and the security, and
the end user experience: whether that is the Velodrome website or a Superchain
integration.

[Sugar](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/sugar/) is deployed on every
blockchain serviced by Velodrome and is providing Superswaps with the
information about the available tokens and pools in real-time.

Along with Sugar, two more onchain components are being used

- [Spot price aggregator](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/spot-price-aggregator),
  a project started by 1inch and used for fetching onchain token prices in
  real-time based on the available pool oracles
- [Mixed Quoter](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/periphery/lens/MixedRouteQuoterV1.sol),
  a modified implementation that comes from the Uniswap v3 release and allows
  us to fetch quotes for finding the best swap route

## SDKs <a id="sdks"></a>

Superswaps require only a regular RPC endpoint in order to set up an
integration. This gives developers absolute freedom in where and how an
integration is done: from user-facing wallets to onchain automations.

Two open source and lightweight abstractions are available and were designed to
help developers build integrations faster. These abstractions serve as SDKs and
handle

- Data fetching: tokens, pools, quotes
- Routing: cyclical graph construction and shortest path computation
- Router planning: construction and serialization of the commands for the swap
  execution
- Private relaying: encryption and submission of the swap commitment

Python SDK is available [on Github](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/sugar-sdk).

The TypeScript version will be announced soon.
