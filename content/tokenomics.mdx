# Tokenomics

Velodrome Finance uses two tokens to manage its utility and governance:

- `$VELO` &mdash; ERC-20 utility token of the protocol
- `$veVELO` &mdash; ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT
  (non-fungible token)

`$VELO` is distributed to liquidity providers through emissions.

`$veVELO` is used for governance. Any `$VELO` holder can vote-escrow their tokens and
receive a `$veVELO` (also known as Lock or veNFT) in exchange. Additional tokens can be
added to the `$veVELO` NFT at any time.

The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period, hence the _ve_ prefix) can be up
to 4 years, following the linear relationship shown below:

- 100 `$VELO` locked for 4 years will become 100 `$veVELO`
- 100 `$VELO` locked for 1 year will become 25 `$veVELO`

The longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight).

Additionally, with Velodrome v2 the Lock (veNFT) can be set into a permanent maximum
lock time. These _permalocked_ Locks (veNFTs) are always treated by the protocol as
being locked for the maximum duration of 4 years, and their voting power does
not decay.

## Initial Distribution

The initial distribution of `$VELO` and `$veVELO` was done for users and
protocols likeliest to contribute to protocol mission to become the liquidity
base layer of the Optimism ecosystem.

### Community

240M (60%) `$VELO` tokens were distributed to the people who have played the
biggest role in incubating Velodrome and those likeliest to contribute to its
long-term success, including:

- `$WEVE` holders (27%, 108M `$VELO`)
- `$OP` network users (18%, 72M `$VELO`)
  - 3755 `$VELO`/wallet &mdash; Addresses qualified as [Repeat Optimism Users](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/#optimism-early-adopters)
- Cross-chain DeFi users (15%, 60M `$VELO`):
  - 3500 `$VELO`/wallet &mdash; Curve Protocol wallets with a 1450+ days (maximum) `$veCRV` lock time
  - 3000 `$VELO`/wallet &mdash; Convex Protocol lockers of `$vlCVX` since new lock contract deployment
  - 3000 `$VELO`/wallet &mdash; Treasure DAO Genesis Mine `$MAGIC` stakers for 1- and 3-month periods
  - 2000 `$VELO`/wallet &mdash; Platypus Protocol stakers with `$vePTP` and `$PTP` balance
  - 500 `$VELO`/wallet &mdash; Redacted Cartel participants in genesis Dutch auction who didn't sell their `$BTRFLY`
  - 500 `$VELO`/wallet &mdash; Eminence Finance wallets affected with EMN, eAAVE, eLINK, eYFI, eSNX or eCRV [balance](https://github.com/banteg/your-eminence/blob/master/shot/01-balances.toml)

### Protocols

The airdrop of 72M (18%) `$veVELO` is aimed at attracting and engaging 10-15
protocols most likely to contribute to Velodrome and Optimism's long-term
success.

### Grants

24M (6%) `$veVELO` were reserved to distribute to partner protocols after the
launch. This was used to engage partners in the ecosystem through grants.

### Foundation

The Foundation received an initial allocation that was used to vote
to drive emissions to key protocol pairs such as `$VELO-$USDC` and support
ongoing protocol development.
The total Foundation allocation was 40M (10%) in `$VELO` and `$veVELO`.

The Foundation vested 100% of its initial allocation in the form of
`$veVELO` and uses it to vote via the Velodrome Protocol in perpetuity.

To help cover ongoing expenses and all the upcoming development efforts, 3% of the
emissions are going to the Foundation address. These emissions are used to lock and
increase the Foudnation's '$veVELO' holdings, distribute as incentives via the
protocol, or engage in various efforts to further the distribution and adoption of
the protocol.

Team compensation breakdown:

- 15,520,816 `$VELO` was set aside for contributor compensation. 0.5% of total emissions, taken from
  emissions to the Foundation described above, will be added to this total for dilution control
  during the 12-month compensation period. All team compensation has been distributed as of June
  2023 with 15,345,334.2 VELO bought back from team members and the remainder distributed as '$VELO'.

### Optimism

Optimism has a vested interest in ensuring that Velodrome achieves its
mission of serving as an ecosystem public good. Optimism received 20M (5%)
`$veVELO` in the initial distribution, to support that interest.

### Genesis Liquidity Pools

Genesis Pools distributed 4M (1%) `$VELO` to liquidity providers of
foundational token pairs to provide better liquidity and user experience from
launch day. Genesis pool emissions were first directed to the
`$VELO`-`$USDC` pool and started a few days before the first epoch votes were cast.
